# GradeSheets

These gradesheets are desgined for organizations dedicated to the memorization of the Holy Quran, allowing progress tracking and reporting for each individual student. It is built using Google Sheets and Google Apps Script (a cloud-based JavaScript platform for automating and extending Google Workspace apps).

For teachers, it's an easily accessible, usable, and transferable tool to record their students' class performances.

For parents and students, it's a place to view progress and performance displayed in an organized and understandable way.

### Background
